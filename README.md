<strong>Project Title:</strong> Trivia Quiz Webpage

<strong>Project Overview:</strong>

I created a trivia quiz webpage where users can answer multiple-choice and free-response questions. The page provides instant feedback on their answers by changing colors and displaying a message indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the content of the trivia quiz.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For styling the webpage.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For adding interactive functionality to the quiz, such as changing button colors and displaying feedback.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple-Choice Question:</strong> Users can select from several answer choices. The selected choice changes color based on correctness, and feedback is shown.</li>
  <li><strong>Free-Response Question:</strong> Users can type in their answer. The input field changes color based on correctness, and feedback is shown.</li>
  <li><strong>Styling:</strong> Custom CSS styles the appearance of the quiz, including colors and layout.</li>
</ul>
